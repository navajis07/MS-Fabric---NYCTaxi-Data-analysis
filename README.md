# 🗽 NYC Taxi Data Analytics using Microsoft Fabric

This project analyzes NYC Yellow Taxi trip data using Microsoft Fabric, demonstrating a complete modern data pipeline from ingestion to interactive reporting.

## 🚀 Problem Statement

The objective of this project was to automate the ingestion, transformation, and visualization of NYC Yellow Taxi trip data using Microsoft Fabric tools including Lakehouse, Dataflows Gen2, Warehouse, and Power BI. This enables stakeholders to monitor key metrics such as revenue, trip count, and passenger patterns on a monthly basis.
